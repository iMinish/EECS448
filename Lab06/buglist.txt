Bug List:

Enqueue() is a bugged function that causes the program to operate more as a Stack rather than a Queue.
Because of this bug inside of enqueue(), it can appear that either peekFront() or dequeue() are buggy as well,
but supplementary tests (TESTS 10-14) show that enqueue() is causing these two functions to provide incorrect
results in certain situations.

Using test13() as an example:
enqueue 10 elements --> FRONT OF QUEUE [10,9,8,7,6,5,4,3,2,1] BACK OF QUEUE
dequeue 5 elements --> FRONT OF QUEUE [5,4,3,2,1] BACK OF QUEUE

This means that if enqueue() was functioning properly, it should work like this:
enqueue 10 elements --> FRONT OF QUEUE [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10] BACK OF QUEUE
dequeue 5 elements --> FRONT OF QUEUE [6,7,8,9,10] BACK OF QUEUE
